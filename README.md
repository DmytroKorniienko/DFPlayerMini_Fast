# DFPlayerMini_Fast
Fast and easy to understand Arduino library to use the DFPlayer Mini MP3 module from DFRobot.com. This is a huge improvement (both in terms of execution speed and simplicity) to the standard library provided by DFRobot.com.

Please note that not all original functions are implemented in this library. In this library, you can control the volume, play a track, and loop a track, change the EQ, pause, and resume only.
